# Throttlade

Throttlade is a Chrome extension that lets you slow down (or “throttle”) HTTP requests so you can study loading behaviour, reproduce race conditions, and massage performance budgets. It ships with a friendly options dashboard for managing rules, live request/response monitoring, and log capture so you can keep an eye on what the extension is doing.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer (the project currently runs on Node 20 in CI)
- npm (bundled with Node)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the build in watch mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs esbuild in watch mode so the extension is recompiled as you edit source files.

### Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

This executes the Jest test suite. The project uses TypeScript-aware Jest configuration, so no extra tooling is required.

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. Build the project (or run `npm run dev` to keep building incrementally).
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the `dist/` directory.
5. The “Throttlade” extension should appear in your toolbar.

Whenever you rebuild, simply refresh the extension in the Extensions page.

## npm Scripts

| Command             | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Start esbuild in watch mode (`--watch`). This is the default choice while developing—you get incremental builds and auto-updated bundles in `dist/`. |
| `npm run build`     | Produce a production build (`esbuild` without `--watch`). Run this when you want a single clean bundle, e.g. before packaging.                       |
| `npm test`          | Execute the Jest test suite. The `tests/` folder contains both unit-level and integration-level tests.                                               |
| `npm run lint`      | Run ESLint across the project (if configured).                                                                                                       |
| `npm run typecheck` | Invoke TypeScript’s compiler in no-emit mode to ensure typing stays healthy.                                                                         |

> Tip: some scripts may be wrappers around `tsx`, `jest`, or direct `node` invocations. Inspect `package.json` if you need a refresher on what each script does behind the scenes.

## Extension Surfaces

- **Popup** (`src/components/app/popup.tsx`) lives in the Chrome action popup. It exposes quick toggles and status.
- **Options Dashboard** (`src/components/app/options.tsx`) is the main management UI. Navigate to `chrome-extension://<id>/options.html` or click “Options” in the extension menu.
- **Background Service Worker** (`src/background/`) keeps global state, handles runtime messages, and broadcasts updates to the UI.
- **Content Scripts** (`src/content/` and `src/inpage/`) wrap page network calls so throttling happens before requests leave the browser.

## Adding a New Build Surface

If you introduce a new UI view or script, remember the triangle:

1. Create your TypeScript entry file under `src/`.
2. Register it in `entryPoints` within `esbuild.config.mjs` so it gets bundled.
3. Add the compiled output to `manifest.json` under the appropriate field (`background`, `content_scripts`, `action.default_popup`, `options_page`, etc.).

A quick lookup table with the existing mapping is in `docs/esbuild-entrypoints.md`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tests fail to run due to Watchman**: Some sandboxed environments disable Watchman sockets. Add `--watchman false` or set `WATCHMAN_SOCK_PATH` to a temporary path when running `jest` manually.
- **Content scripts not updating**: After running `npm run dev`, refresh the extension via `chrome://extensions` to ensure Chrome picks up the rebuilt bundles.
- **Chrome complains about permissions**: Double-check `manifest.json` when adding new APIs—Chrome is strict about listed permissions and host match patterns.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Please run `npm test` and `npm run lint` before committing so the CI pipeline stays green.

Happy debugging!
